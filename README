This code is meant to run on the Arduino Yun. It will incorporate data acquired from
  * RHT03 sensor (relative humidity and temperature sensor)
  * SparkFun Electret Microphone
  * Walgreens Digital Glass Scale (connections instructions in other document)

This sketch will make use of the Temboo library to append data to a Google Spreadsheet. 

With a Google account, and a spreadsheet, you can constantly be uploading data in real time. The columns in the spreadsheet must be labeled. The labels do not matter. 

You will also need a Temboo account and can update your Temboo account information in the accompanying TembooAccount.h file. For more information about how to do this, visit https://www.temboo.com/arduino/update-google-spreadsheet.

The current code has been calibrated and works with a Walgreens Digital Glass Scale. A full document on how to connect the scale to the Arduino can be found online at http://github.com/glenmeyerowitz/readScale. The scale will need to be calibrated before use. Calibration instructions are also online.
