This code is meant to run on the Arduino Yun. It will incorporate data acquired from
  * RHT03 sensor (relative humidity and temperature sensor)
  * SparkFun Electret Microphone

Prepare your SD card with an empty folder in the SD root named "arduino" and a subfolder of that named "www". This will ensure that the YÃºn will create a link to the SD to the "/mnt/sd" path.

In this sketch folder is a basic webpage and a copy of zepto.js, a minimized version of jQuery.  

When you upload your sketch, these files will be placed in the /arduino/www/TemperatureWebPanel folder on your SD card.

You can then go to http://arduino.local/sd/IntelligentBeehive to see the output of this sketch.
